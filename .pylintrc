#project adapted to pylint 1.5.4, astroid 1.4.4
#
# (C) convention, for programming standard violation
# (R) refactor, for bad code smell
# (W) warning, for python specific problems
# (E) error, for much probably bugs in the code
# (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing further processing.
