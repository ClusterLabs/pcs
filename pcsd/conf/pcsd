# - When creating new cluster, pcs generates new SSL certificate for pcsd using
#   the name of the first cluster node as CN and sends the certificate to all
#   nodes in the new cluster. Thus all pcsds in the cluster have the same SSL
#   certificate.

#   certificate from the local node to the new node. Thus pcsd on the new node
#   has the same SSL certificate as the local node.
