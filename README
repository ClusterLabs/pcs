PCS - Pacemaker/Corosync configuration system

Quick start

To install pcs run the following in terminal

# tar -xzvf pcs-0.9.143.tar.gz
# cd pcs-0.9.143
# make install

If you are using Debian or Debian-based distribution (such as Ubuntu), run
the following instead:

# tar -xzvf pcs-0.9.143.tar.gz
# cd pcs-0.9.143
# make install install_settings=true

This will install pcs into /usr/sbin/pcs

To create a cluster run the following commands on all nodes (replacing node1,
node2, node3 with a list of nodes in the cluster).
# pcs cluster setup --local --name cluster_name node1 node2 node3

Then run the following command on all nodes:
# pcs cluster start

After a few moments the cluster should startup and you can get the status of
the cluster
# pcs status

After this you can add resources and stonith agents:
# pcs resource help
and
# pcs stonith help

You can also install pcsd which operates as a GUI and remote server for pcs.
pcsd may also be necessary in order to follow the guides on the clusterlabs.org
website.  To install pcsd run the following commands from the root of your pcs
directory.  (You must have the ruby bundler gem installed, rubygem-bundler in
Fedora, and development packages installed)

# cd pcsd ; make get_gems ; cd ..
# make install_pcsd

If you are using Debian or Debian-based distribution (such as Ubuntu), run
the following instead:

# cd pcsd ; make get_gems ; cd ..
# make install_pcsd install_settings=true

If you are using GNU/Linux its now time to:
# systemctl daemon-reload

Currently this is built into Fedora (other distributions to follow).  You can
