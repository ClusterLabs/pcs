Show options for the specified resource. If \fB\-\-full\fR is specified, all options including advanced and deprecated ones are shown.
.TP
create <resource id> [<standard>:[<provider>:]]<type> [resource options] [\fBop\fR <operation action> <operation options> [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [\fBmeta\fR <meta options>...] [\fBclone\fR [<clone id>] [<clone options>] | promotable [<clone id>] [<promotable options>] | \fB\-\-group\fR <group id> [\fB\-\-before\fR <resource id> | \fB\-\-after\fR <resource id>] | \fBbundle\fR <bundle id>] [\fB\-\-disabled\fR] [\fB\-\-agent\-validation\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-default\-ops\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Create specified resource. If \fBclone\fR is used a clone resource is created. If \fBpromotable\fR is used a promotable clone resource is created. If \fB\-\-group\fR is specified the resource is added to the group named. You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resource relatively to some resource already existing in the group. If \fBbundle\fR is specified, resource will be created inside of the specified bundle. If \fB\-\-disabled\fR is specified the resource is not started automatically. If \fB\-\-agent\-validation\fR is specified, resource agent validate\-all action will be used to validate resource options. If \fB\-\-no\-default\-ops\fR is specified, only monitor operations are created for the resource and all other operations use default settings. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to start and then return 0 if the resource is started, or 1 if the resource has not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

Example: Create a new resource called 'VirtualIP' with IP address 192.168.0.99, netmask of 32, monitored everything 30 seconds, on eth2: pcs resource create VirtualIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=192.168.0.99 cidr_netmask=32 nic=eth2 op monitor interval=30s
.TP

Deletes the resource, group, bundle or clone (and all resources within the group/bundle/clone).
.TP
enable <resource id | tag id>... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Allow the cluster to start the resources. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources may remain stopped. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to start and then return 0 if the resources are started, or 1 if the resources have not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
disable <resource id | tag id>... [\fB\-\-safe\fR [\fB\-\-brief\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-strict\fR]] [\fB\-\-simulate\fR [\fB\-\-brief\fR]] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Attempt to stop the resources if they are running and forbid the cluster from starting them again. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources may remain started.
.br
If \fB\-\-safe\fR is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made if other than specified resources would be affected in any way. If \fB\-\-brief\fR is also specified, only errors are printed.
.br
If \fB\-\-no\-strict\fR is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made if other than specified resources would get stopped or demoted. Moving resources between nodes is allowed.
.br
If \fB\-\-simulate\fR is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made and the effect of the changes will be printed instead. If \fB\-\-brief\fR is also specified, only a list of affected resources will be printed.
.br
If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to stop and then return 0 if the resources are stopped or 1 if the resources have not stopped. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
safe\-disable <resource id | tag id>... [\fB\-\-brief\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-strict\fR] [\fB\-\-simulate\fR [\fB\-\-brief\fR]] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]] [\fB\-\-force\fR]
Attempt to stop the resources if they are running and forbid the cluster from starting them again. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources may remain started. No changes to the cluster configuration will be made if other than specified resources would be affected in any way.
.br
If \fB\-\-brief\fR is specified, only errors are printed.
.br
If \fB\-\-no\-strict\fR is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made if other than specified resources would get stopped or demoted. Moving resources between nodes is allowed.
.br
If \fB\-\-simulate\fR is specified, no changes to the cluster configuration will be made and the effect of the changes will be printed instead. If \fB\-\-brief\fR is also specified, only a list of affected resources will be printed.
.br
If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to stop and then return 0 if the resources are stopped or 1 if the resources have not stopped. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.br
If \fB\-\-force\fR is specified, checks for safe disable will be skipped.
.TP
restart <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-wait\fR=n]
Restart the resource specified. If a node is specified and if the resource is a clone or bundle it will be restarted only on the node specified. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, then we will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to be restarted and return 0 if the restart was successful or 1 if it was not.
.TP
debug\-start <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to start on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from starting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to start.
.TP
debug\-stop <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to stop on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from stopping the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to stop.
.TP
debug\-promote <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be promoted on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from promoting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to promote.
.TP
debug\-demote <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be demoted on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from demoting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to demote.
.TP
debug\-monitor <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be monitored on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from monitoring the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to be monitored.
.TP
move <resource id> [destination node] [\fB\-\-promoted\fR] [\fB\-\-strict\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Move the resource off the node it is currently running on. This is achieved by creating a \-INFINITY location constraint to ban the node.  If destination node is specified the resource will be moved to that node by creating an INFINITY location constraint to prefer the destination node. The constraint needed for moving the resource will be automatically removed once the resource is running on it's new location. The command will fail in case it is not possible to verify that the resource will not be moved back after deleting the constraint.

If \fB\-\-strict\fR is specified, the command will also fail if other resources would be affected.

If \fB\-\-promoted\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

NOTE: This command has been changed in pcs\-0.11. It is equivalent to command 'resource move <resource id> \fB\-\-autodelete\fR' from pcs\-0.10.9. Legacy functionality of the 'resource move' command is still available as 'resource move\-with\-constraint <resource id>'.

If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them use 'pcs constraint location avoids'.
.TP
move\-with\-constraint <resource id> [destination node] [lifetime=<lifetime>] [\fB\-\-promoted\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Move the resource off the node it is currently running on by creating a \-INFINITY location constraint to ban the node. If destination node is specified the resource will be moved to that node by creating an INFINITY location constraint to prefer the destination node.

If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to infinity and the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or 'pcs constraint delete'. Lifetime is expected to be specified as ISO 8601 duration (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

If \fB\-\-promoted\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them use 'pcs constraint location avoids'.
.TP
ban <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-promoted\fR] [lifetime=<lifetime>] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Prevent the resource id specified from running on the node (or on the current node it is running on if no node is specified) by creating a \-INFINITY location constraint.

If \fB\-\-promoted\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to infinity and the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or 'pcs constraint delete'. Lifetime is expected to be specified as ISO 8601 duration (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

.TP
clear <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-promoted\fR] [\fB\-\-expired\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove constraints created by move and/or ban on the specified resource (and node if specified).

If \fB\-\-promoted\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the Promoted role and promotable clone id must be used (instead of the resource id).

If \fB\-\-expired\fR is specified, only constraints with expired lifetimes will be removed.

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including starting and/or moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
standards
List available resource agent standards supported by this installation (OCF, LSB, etc.).

update <resource id> [resource options] [op [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [meta <meta operations>...] [\fB\-\-agent\-validation\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Add, remove or change options of specified resource, clone or multi\-state resource. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='.

If an operation (op) is specified it will update the first found operation with the same action on the specified resource. If no operation with that action exists then a new operation will be created. (WARNING: all existing options on the updated operation will be reset if not specified.) If you want to create multiple monitor operations you should use the 'op add' & 'op remove' commands.

If \fB\-\-agent\-validation\fR is specified, resource agent validate\-all action will be used to validate resource options.

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the changes to take effect and then return 0 if the changes have been processed or 1 otherwise. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

.TP
group add <group id> <resource id> [resource id] ... [resource id] [\fB\-\-before\fR <resource id> | \fB\-\-after\fR <resource id>] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Add the specified resource to the group, creating the group if it does not exist. If the resource is present in another group it is moved to the new group. If the group remains empty after move, it is deleted (for cloned groups, the clone is deleted as well). The delete operation may fail in case the group is referenced within the configuration, e.g. by constraints. In that case, use 'pcs resource ungroup' command prior to moving all resources out of the group.

You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resources relatively to some resource already existing in the group. By adding resources to a group they are already in and specifying \fB\-\-after\fR or \fB\-\-before\fR you can move the resources in the group.

If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
group delete <group id> [resource id]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove the group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
group remove <group id> [resource id]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove the group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
ungroup <group id> [resource id]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove the group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
clone <resource id | group id> [<clone id>] [clone options]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Set up the specified resource or group as a clone. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including starting clone instances if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
promotable <resource id | group id> [<clone id>] [clone options]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]

cleanup [<resource id | stonith id>] [node=<node>] [operation=<operation> [interval=<interval>]] [\fB\-\-strict\fR]
Make the cluster forget failed operations from history of the resource / stonith device and re\-detect its current state. This can be useful to purge knowledge of past failures that have since been resolved.

If the named resource is part of a group, or one numbered instance of a clone or bundled resource, the clean\-up applies to the whole collective resource unless \fB\-\-strict\fR is given.

If a resource id / stonith id is not specified then all resources / stonith devices will be cleaned up.

If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be cleaned up.
.TP
refresh [<resource id | stonith id>] [node=<node>] [\fB\-\-strict\fR]
Make the cluster forget the complete operation history (including failures) of the resource / stonith device and re\-detect its current state. If you are interested in forgetting failed operations only, use the 'pcs resource cleanup' command.

If the named resource is part of a group, or one numbered instance of a clone or bundled resource, the refresh applies to the whole collective resource unless \fB\-\-strict\fR is given.

If a resource id / stonith id is not specified then all resources / stonith devices will be refreshed.

If a node is not specified then resources / stonith devices on all nodes will be refreshed.
.TP
failcount [show [<resource id | stonith id>] [node=<node>] [operation=<operation> [interval=<interval>]]] [\fB\-\-full\fR]
Show current failcount for resources and stonith devices, optionally filtered by a resource / stonith device, node, operation and its interval. If \fB\-\-full\fR is specified do not sum failcounts per resource / stonith device and node. Use 'pcs resource cleanup' or 'pcs resource refresh' to reset failcounts.
.TP
relocate dry\-run [resource1] [resource2] ...
The same as 'relocate run' but has no effect on the cluster.
.TP
relocate run [resource1] [resource2] ...
Relocate specified resources to their preferred nodes.  If no resources are specified, relocate all resources.  This command calculates the preferred node for each resource while ignoring resource stickiness.  Then it creates location constraints which will cause the resources to move to their preferred nodes.  Once the resources have been moved the constraints are deleted automatically.  Note that the preferred node is calculated based on current cluster status, constraints, location of resources and other settings and thus it might change over time.
.TP
relocate show
Display current status of resources and their optimal node ignoring resource stickiness.
.TP
relocate clear
Remove all constraints created by the 'relocate run' command.
.TP
utilization [<resource id> [<name>=<value> ...]]
Add specified utilization options to specified resource. If resource is not specified, shows utilization of all resources. If utilization options are not specified, shows utilization of specified resource. Utilization option should be in format name=value, value has to be integer. Options may be removed by setting an option without a value. Example: pcs resource utilization TestResource cpu= ram=20
.TP
relations <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
Display relations of a resource specified by its id with other resources in a tree structure. Supported types of resource relations are: ordering constraints, ordering set constraints, relations defined by resource hierarchy (clones, groups, bundles). If \fB\-\-full\fR is used, more verbose output will be printed.

Create a cluster from the listed nodes and synchronize cluster configuration files to them. If \fB\-\-corosync_conf\fR is specified, do not connect to other nodes and save corosync.conf to the specified path; see 'Local only mode' below for details.

Nodes are specified by their names and optionally their addresses. If no addresses are specified for a node, pcs will configure corosync to communicate with that node using an address provided in 'pcs host auth' command. Otherwise, pcs will configure corosync to communicate with the node using the specified addresses.

Transport knet:
.br
This is the default transport. It allows configuring traffic encryption and compression as well as using multiple addresses (links) for nodes.
.br
Transport options are: ip_version, knet_pmtud_interval, link_mode
.br
Link options are: link_priority, linknumber, mcastport, ping_interval, ping_precision, ping_timeout, pong_count, transport (udp or sctp)
.br
Each 'link' followed by options sets options for one link in the order the links are defined by nodes' addresses. You can set link options for a subset of links using a linknumber. See examples below.
.br
Compression options are: level, model, threshold
.br
Crypto options are: cipher, hash, model
.br
By default, encryption is enabled with cipher=aes256 and hash=sha256. To disable encryption, set cipher=none and hash=none.

Transports udp and udpu:
.br
These transports are limited to one address per node. They do not support traffic encryption nor compression.
.br
Transport options are: ip_version, netmtu
.br
Link options are: bindnetaddr, broadcast, mcastaddr, mcastport, ttl

Totem and quorum can be configured regardless of used transport.
.br
Totem options are: block_unlisted_ips, consensus, downcheck, fail_recv_const, heartbeat_failures_allowed, hold, join, max_messages, max_network_delay, merge, miss_count_const, send_join, seqno_unchanged_const, token, token_coefficient, token_retransmit, token_retransmits_before_loss_const, window_size
.br
Quorum options are: auto_tie_breaker, last_man_standing, last_man_standing_window, wait_for_all

Transports and their options, link, compression, crypto and totem options are all documented in corosync.conf(5) man page; knet link options are prefixed 'knet_' there, compression options are prefixed 'knet_compression_' and crypto options are prefixed 'crypto_'. Quorum options are documented in votequorum(5) man page.

\fB\-\-no\-cluster\-uuid\fR will not generate a unique ID for the cluster. \fB\-\-enable\fR will configure the cluster to start on nodes boot. \fB\-\-start\fR will start the cluster right after creating it. \fB\-\-wait\fR will wait up to 'n' seconds for the cluster to start. \fB\-\-no\-keys\-sync\fR will skip creating and distributing pcsd SSL certificate and key and corosync and pacemaker authkey files. Use this if you provide your own certificates and keys.

Local only mode:
.br
By default, pcs connects to all specified nodes to verify they can be used in the new cluster and to send cluster configuration files to them. If this is not what you want, specify \fB\-\-corosync_conf\fR option followed by a file path. Pcs will save corosync.conf to the specified file and will not connect to cluster nodes. These are the tasks that pcs skips in that case:
.br
* make sure the nodes are not running or configured to run a cluster already
.br
* make sure cluster packages are installed on all nodes and their versions are compatible
.br
* make sure there are no cluster configuration files on any node (run 'pcs cluster destroy' and remove pcs_settings.conf file on all nodes)
.br
* synchronize corosync and pacemaker authkeys, /etc/corosync/authkey and /etc/pacemaker/authkey respectively, and the corosync.conf file
.br
* authenticate the cluster nodes against each other ('pcs cluster auth' or 'pcs host auth' command)
.br
* synchronize pcsd certificates (so that pcs web UI can be used in an HA mode)

Examples:
.br
Create a cluster with default settings:
    pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 node2
.br
Create a cluster using two links:
    pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 addr=10.0.1.11 addr=10.0.2.11 node2 addr=10.0.1.12 addr=10.0.2.12
.br
Set link options for all links. Link options are matched to the links in order. The first link (link 0) has sctp transport, the second link (link 1) has mcastport 55405:
    pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 addr=10.0.1.11 addr=10.0.2.11 node2 addr=10.0.1.12 addr=10.0.2.12 transport knet link transport=sctp link mcastport=55405
.br
Set link options for the second and fourth links only. Link options are matched to the links based on the linknumber option (the first link is link 0):
    pcs cluster setup newcluster node1 addr=10.0.1.11 addr=10.0.2.11 addr=10.0.3.11 addr=10.0.4.11 node2 addr=10.0.1.12 addr=10.0.2.12 addr=10.0.3.12 addr=10.0.4.12 transport knet link linknumber=3 mcastport=55405 link linknumber=1 transport=sctp

Allowed SBD options: SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT (default: 5), SBD_DELAY_START (default: no), SBD_STARTMODE (default: always) and SBD_TIMEOUT_ACTION. SBD options are documented in sbd(8) man page. It is possible to specify up to 3 devices per node. If \fB\-\-no\-watchdog\-validation\fR is specified, validation of watchdogs will be skipped.

.B WARNING: Cluster has to be restarted in order to apply these changes.

.B WARNING: By default, it is tested whether the specified watchdog is supported. This may cause a restart of the system when a watchdog with no\-way\-out\-feature enabled is present. Use \-\-no\-watchdog\-validation to skip watchdog validation.

Example of enabling SBD in cluster with watchdogs on node1 will be /dev/watchdog2, on node2 /dev/watchdog1, /dev/watchdog0 on all other nodes, device /dev/sdb on node1, device /dev/sda on all other nodes and watchdog timeout will bet set to 10 seconds:

role create <role id> [description=<description>] [((read | write | deny) (xpath <query> | id <id>))...]
Create a role with the id and (optional) description specified. Each role can also have an unlimited number of permissions (read/write/deny) applied to either an xpath query or the id of a specific element in the cib.
.br
Permissions are applied to the selected XML element's entire XML subtree (all elements enclosed within it). Write permission grants the ability to create, modify, or remove the element and its subtree, and also the ability to create any "scaffolding" elements (enclosing elements that do not have attributes other than an ID). Permissions for more specific matches (more deeply nested elements) take precedence over more general ones. If multiple permissions are configured for the same match (for example, in different roles applied to the same user), any deny permission takes precedence, then write, then lastly read.
.br
An xpath may include an attribute expression to select only elements that match the expression, but the permission still applies to the entire element (and its subtree), not to the attribute alone. For example, using the xpath "//*[@name]" to give write permission would allow changes to the entirety of all elements that have a "name" attribute and everything enclosed by those elements. There is no way currently to give permissions for just one attribute of an element. That is to say, you can not define an ACL that allows someone to read just the dc\-uuid attribute of the cib tag \- that would select the cib element and give read access to the entire CIB.

permission add <role id> ((read | write | deny) (xpath <query> | id <id>))...
Add the listed permissions to the role specified. Permissions are applied to either an xpath query or the id of a specific element in the CIB.

Permissions are applied to the selected XML element's entire XML subtree (all elements enclosed within it). Write permission grants the ability to create, modify, or remove the element and its subtree, and also the ability to create any "scaffolding" elements (enclosing elements that do not have attributes other than an ID).

device add [<generic options>] model <device model> [<model options>] [heuristics <heuristics options>]
Add a quorum device to the cluster. Quorum device should be configured first with "pcs qdevice setup". It is not possible to use more than one quorum device in a cluster simultaneously.
.br
Currently the only supported model is 'net'. It requires model options 'algorithm' and 'host' to be specified. Options are documented in corosync\-qdevice(8) man page; generic options are 'sync_timeout' and 'timeout', for model net options check the quorum.device.net section, for heuristics options see the quorum.device.heuristics section. Pcs automatically creates and distributes TLS certificates and sets the 'tls' model option to the default value 'on'.

device update [<generic options>] [model <model options>] [heuristics <heuristics options>]
Add, remove or change quorum device options. Unspecified options will be kept unchanged. If you wish to remove an option, set it to empty value, i.e. 'option_name='. Requires the cluster to be stopped. Model and options are all documented in corosync\-qdevice(8) man page; for heuristics options check the quorum.device.heuristics subkey section, for model options check the quorum.device.<device model> subkey sections.

WARNING: If you want to change "host" option of qdevice model net, use "pcs quorum device remove" and "pcs quorum device add" commands to set up configuration properly unless old and new host is the same machine.
.TP

Set expected votes in the live cluster to specified value.  This only affects the live cluster, not changes any configuration files.
.TP
unblock [\fB\-\-force\fR]
Cancel waiting for all nodes when establishing quorum.  Useful in situations where you know the cluster is inquorate, but you are confident that the cluster should proceed with resource management regardless.  This command should ONLY be used when nodes which the cluster is waiting for have been confirmed to be powered off and to have no access to shared resources.

.B WARNING: If the nodes are not actually powered off or they do have access to shared resources, data corruption/cluster failure can occur. To prevent accidental running of this command, \-\-force or interactive user response is required in order to proceed.

.br
Note that the ticket must not be already granted in given booth formation; for an ad-hoc (and, in the worst case, abrupt, for a lack of a direct atomicity) change of this preference baring direct interventions at the sites, the ticket needs to be revoked first, only then it can be granted at another site again.
.TP
ticket revoke <ticket> [<site address>]
Revoke the ticket in the booth formation as identified with one of its member sites specified by the address. When this specification is omitted, site address that has been specified with a prior 'pcs booth create' command is used.

.SH USING \-\-FORCE IN PCS COMMANDS
Various pcs commands accept the \fB\-\-force\fR option. Its purpose is to override some of checks that pcs is doing or some of errors that may occur when a pcs command is run. When such error occurs, pcs will print the error with a note it may be overridden. The exact behavior of the option is different for each pcs command. Using the \fB\-\-force\fR option can lead into situations that would normally be prevented by logic of pcs commands and therefore \fBits use is strongly discouraged unless you know what you are doing\fR.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
EDITOR
 Path to a plain\-text editor. This is used when pcs is requested to present a text for the user to edit.
.TP
no_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy, NO_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY
 These environment variables (listed according to their priorities) control how pcs handles proxy servers when connecting to cluster nodes. See curl(1) man page for details.
