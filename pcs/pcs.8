show [resource id] [\fB\-\-full\fR] [\fB\-\-groups\fR]
Show all currently configured resources or if a resource is specified show the options for the configured resource.  If \fB\-\-full\fR is specified all configured resource options will be displayed.  If \fB\-\-groups\fR is specified, only show groups (and their resources).
.TP
list [<standard|provider|type>] [\fB\-\-nodesc\fR]
Show list of all available resources, optionally filtered by specified type, standard or provider. If \fB\-\-nodesc\fR is used then descriptions of resources are not printed.
.TP
describe <standard:provider:type|type>
Show options for the specified resource
.TP
create <resource id> <standard:provider:type|type> [resource options] [op <operation action> <operation options> [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [meta <meta options>...] [\fB\-\-clone\fR <clone options> | \fB\-\-master\fR <master options> | \fB\-\-group\fR <group name> [\fB\-\-before\fR <resource id> | \fB\-\-after\fR <resource id>]] [\fB\-\-disabled\fR]
Create specified resource.  If \fB\-\-clone\fR is used a clone resource is created if \fB\-\-master\fR is specified a master/slave resource is created.  If \fB\-\-group\fR is specified the resource is added to the group named.  You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resource relatively to some resource already existing in the group.  If \fB\-\-disabled\fR is specified the resource is not started automatically. Example: pcs resource create VirtualIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \e ip=192.168.0.99 cidr_netmask=32 nic=eth2 op monitor interval=30s \e Create a new resource called 'VirtualIP' with IP address 192.168.0.99, netmask of 32, monitored everything 30 seconds, on eth2.
.TP
delete <resource id|group id|master id|clone id>
Deletes the resource, group, master or clone (and all resources within the group/master/clone).
.TP
enable <resource id> [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Allow the cluster to start the resource. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resource may remain stopped.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 30 seconds (or 'n' seconds) for the resource to start and then return 0 if the resource is started, or 1 if the resource has not yet started.
.TP
disable <resource id> [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Attempt to stop the resource if it is running and forbid the cluster from starting it again.  Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resource may remain started.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 30 seconds (or 'n' seconds) for the resource to stop and then return 0 if the resource is stopped or 1 if the resource has not stopped.
.TP
debug\-start <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to start on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from starting the resource. Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output. This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to start.
.TP
move <resource id> [destination node] [\fB\-\-master\fR] [lifetime=<lifetime>]
Move resource off current node (and optionally onto destination node). If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id). If lifetime is not specified it defaults to infinite.
.TP
ban <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-master\fR] [lifetime=<lifetime>]
Prevent the resource id specified from running on the node (or on the current node it is running on if no node is specified). If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id). If lifetime is not specified it defaults to infinite.
.TP
clear <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-master\fR]
Remove constraints created by move and/or ban on the specified resource (and node if specified). If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id).
.TP
standards
List available resource agent standards supported by this installation. (OCF, LSB, etc.)
.TP
providers
List available OCF resource agent providers
.TP
agents [standard[:provider]]
List available agents optionally filtered by standard and provider
.TP
update <resource id> [resource options] [op [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [meta <meta operations>...]
Add/Change options to specified resource, clone or multi\-state resource.  If an operation (op) is specified it will update the first found operation with the same action on the specified resource, if no operation with that action exists then a new operation will be created (WARNING: all current options on the update op will be reset if not specified). If you want to create multiple monitor operations you should use the add_operation & remove_operation commands.
.TP
op add <resource id> <operation action> [operation properties]
Add operation for specified resource
.TP
op remove <resource id> <operation action> [<operation properties>...]
Remove specified operation (note: you must specify the exact operation properties to properly remove an existing operation).
.TP
op remove <operation id>
Remove the specified operation id
.TP
op defaults [options]
Set default values for operations, if no options are passed, lists currently configured defaults
.TP
meta <resource id | group id | master id | clone id> <meta options>
Add specified options to the specified resource, group, master/slave or clone.  Meta options should be in the format of name=value, options may be removed by setting an option without a value. Example: pcs resource meta TestResource failure\-timeout=50 stickiness=
.TP
group add <group name> <resource id> [resource id] ... [resource id] [\fB\-\-before\fR <resource id> | \fB\-\-after\fR <resource id>]
Add the specified resource to the group, creating the group if it does not exist.  If the resource is present in another group it is moved to the new group.  You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resources relatively to some resource already existing in the group.
.TP
group remove <group name> <resource id> [resource id] ... [resource id]
Remove the specified resource(s) from the group, removing the group if it no resources remain.
.TP
ungroup <group name> [resource id] ... [resource id]
Remove the group (Note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are specified, remove the specified resources from the group
.TP
clone <resource id | group id> [clone options]...
Setup up the specified resource or group as a clone
.TP
unclone <resource id | group name>
Remove the clone which contains the specified group or resource (the resource or group will not be removed)
.TP
master [<master/slave name>] <resource id | group name> [options]
Configure a resource or group as a multi\-state (master/slave) resource. Note: to remove a master you must remove the resource/group it contains.

.TP
unmanage <resource id> ... [resource n]
Set resources listed to unmanaged mode
.TP
defaults [options]

.TP
cleanup <resource id>
Cleans up the resource in the lrmd (useful to reset the resource status and failcount). This tells the cluster to forget the operation history of a resource and re-detect its current state. This can be useful to purge knowledge of past failures that have since been resolved.
.TP
failcount show <resource id> [node]
Show current failcount for specified resource from all nodes or only on specified node
.TP
failcount reset <resource id> [node]
Reset failcount for specified resource on all nodes or only on specified node. This tells the cluster to forget how many times a resource has failed in the past.  This may allow the resource to be started or moved to a more preferred location.
.SS "cluster"
.TP
auth [node] [...] [\fB\-u\fR username] [\fB\-p\fR password] [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR]
Authenticate pcs to pcsd on nodes specified, or on all nodes configured in corosync.conf if no nodes are specified (authorization tokens are stored in ~/.pcs/tokens or /var/lib/pcsd/tokens for root).  By default all nodes are also authenticated to each other, using \fB\-\-local\fR only authenticates the local node (and does not authenticate the remote nodes with each other).  Using \fB\-\-force\fR forces re-authentication to occur.
.TP
setup [\fB\-\-start\fR] [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fB\-\-enable\fR] \fB\-\-name\fR <cluster name> <node1[,node1-altaddr]> [node2[,node2-altaddr]] [..] [\fB\-\-transport\fR <udpu|udp>] [\fB\-\-rrpmode\fR active|passive] [\fB\-\-addr0\fR <addr/net> [[[\fB\-\-mcast0\fR <address>] [\fB\-\-mcastport0\fR <port>] [\fB\-\-ttl0\fR <ttl>]] | [\fB\-\-broadcast0\fR]] [\fB\-\-addr1\fR <addr/net> [[[\fB\-\-mcast1\fR <address>] [\fB\-\-mcastport1\fR <port>] [\fB\-\-ttl1\fR <ttl>]] | [\fB\-\-broadcast1\fR]]]] [\fB\-\-wait_for_all\fR=<0|1>] [\fB\-\-auto_tie_breaker\fR=<0|1>] [\fB\-\-last_man_standing\fR=<0|1> [\fB\-\-last_man_standing_window\fR=<time in ms>]] [\fB\-\-token\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-token_coefficient\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-join\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-consensus\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-miss_count_const\fR <count>] [\fB\-\-fail_recv_const\fR <failures>]
Configure corosync and sync configuration out to listed nodes. \fB\-\-local\fR will only perform changes on the local node, \fB\-\-start\fR will also start the cluster on the specified nodes, \fB\-\-enable\fR will enable corosync and pacemaker on node startup, \fB\-\-transport\fR allows specification of corosync transport (default: udpu), \fB\-\-rrpmode\fR allows you to set the RRP mode of the system. Currently only 'passive' is supported or tested (using 'active' is not recommended). The \fB\-\-wait_for_all\fR, \fB\-\-auto_tie_breaker\fR, \fB\-\-last_man_standing\fR, \fB\-\-last_man_standing_window\fR options are all documented in corosync's votequorum(5) man page.

\fB\-\-ipv6\fR will configure corosync to use ipv6 (instead of ipv4)

\fB\-\-token\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds until a token loss is declared after not receiving a token (default 1000 ms)

\fB\-\-token_coefficient\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds used for clusters with at least 3 nodes as a coefficient for real token timeout calculation (token + (number_of_nodes - 2) * token_coefficient) (default 650 ms)

\fB\-\-join\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds to wait for join messages (default 50 ms)

\fB\-\-consensus\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds to wait for consensus to be achieved before starting a new round of membership configuration (default 1200 ms)

\fB\-\-miss_count_const\fR <count> sets the maximum number of times on receipt of a token a message is checked for retransmission before a retransmission occurs (default 5 messages)

\fB\-\-fail_recv_const\fR <failures> specifies how many rotations of the token without receiving any messages when messages should be received may occur before a new configuration is formed (default 2500 failures)


Configuring Redundant Ring Protocol (RRP)

When using udpu (the default) specifying nodes, specify the ring 0
address first followed by a ',' and then the ring 1 address.

Example: pcs cluster setup \-\-name cname nodeA-0,nodeA-1 nodeB-0,nodeB-1

When using udp, using \fB\-\-addr0\fR and \fB\-\-addr1\fR will allow you to configure
rrp mode for corosync.  It's recommended to use a network (instead of
IP address) for \fB\-\-addr0\fR and \fB\-\-addr1\fR so the same corosync.conf file can
be used around the cluster.  \fB\-\-mcast0\fR defaults to 239.255.1.1 and
\fB\-\-mcast1\fR defaults to 239.255.2.1, \fB\-\-mcastport0/1\fR default to 5405 and
ttl defaults to 1. If \fB\-\-broadcast\fR is specified, \fB\-\-mcast0/1\fR,
\fB\-\-mcastport0/1\fR & \fB\-\-ttl0/1\fR are ignored.
