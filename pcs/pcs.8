[show [<resource id>] | \fB\-\-full\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR | \fB\-\-hide\-inactive\fR]
Show all currently configured resources or if a resource is specified show the options for the configured resource.  If \fB\-\-full\fR is specified, all configured resource options will be displayed.  If \fB\-\-groups\fR is specified, only show groups (and their resources).  If \fB\-\-hide\-inactive\fR is specified, only show active resources.
.TP
list [filter] [\fB\-\-nodesc\fR]
Show list of all available resource agents (if filter is provided then only resource agents matching the filter will be shown). If \fB\-\-nodesc\fR is used then descriptions of resource agents are not printed.
.TP
describe [<standard>:[<provider>:]]<type> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
Show options for the specified resource. If \fB\-\-full\fR is specified, all options including advanced ones are shown.
.TP
create <resource id> [<standard>:[<provider>:]]<type> [resource options] [\fBop\fR <operation action> <operation options> [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [\fBmeta\fR <meta options>...] [\fBclone\fR [<clone options>] | \fBmaster\fR [<master options>] | \fB\-\-group\fR <group id> [\fB\-\-before\fR <resource id> | \fB\-\-after\fR <resource id>] | \fBbundle\fR <bundle id>] [\fB\-\-disabled\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Create specified resource. If \fBclone\fR is used a clone resource is created. If \fBmaster\fR is specified a master/slave resource is created. If \fB\-\-group\fR is specified the resource is added to the group named. You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resource relatively to some resource already existing in the group. If \fBbundle\fR is specified, resource will be created inside of the specified bundle. If \fB\-\-disabled\fR is specified the resource is not started automatically. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to start and then return 0 if the resource is started, or 1 if the resource has not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

Example: Create a new resource called 'VirtualIP' with IP address 192.168.0.99, netmask of 32, monitored everything 30 seconds, on eth2: pcs resource create VirtualIP ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=192.168.0.99 cidr_netmask=32 nic=eth2 op monitor interval=30s
.TP
delete <resource id|group id|master id|clone id>
Deletes the resource, group, master or clone (and all resources within the group/master/clone).
.TP
enable <resource id>... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Allow the cluster to start the resources. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources may remain stopped. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to start and then return 0 if the resources are started, or 1 if the resources have not yet started. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
disable <resource id>... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Attempt to stop the resources if they are running and forbid the cluster from starting them again. Depending on the rest of the configuration (constraints, options, failures, etc), the resources may remain started. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resources to stop and then return 0 if the resources are stopped or 1 if the resources have not stopped. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
restart <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-wait\fR=n]
Restart the resource specified. If a node is specified and if the resource is a clone or master/slave it will be restarted only on the node specified.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, then we will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to be restarted and return 0 if the restart was successful or 1 if it was not.
.TP
debug\-start <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to start on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from starting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to start.
.TP
debug\-stop <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to stop on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from stopping the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to stop.
.TP
debug\-promote <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be promoted on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from promoting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to promote.
.TP
debug\-demote <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be demoted on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from demoting the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to demote.
.TP
debug\-monitor <resource id> [\fB\-\-full\fR]
This command will force the specified resource to be monitored on this node ignoring the cluster recommendations and print the output from monitoring the resource.  Using \fB\-\-full\fR will give more detailed output.  This is mainly used for debugging resources that fail to be monitored.
.TP
move <resource id> [destination node] [\fB\-\-master\fR] [lifetime=<lifetime>] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Move the resource off the node it is currently running on by creating a \-INFINITY location constraint to ban the node.  If destination node is specified the resource will be moved to that node by creating an INFINITY location constraint to prefer the destination node.  If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id).  If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to infinity and the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or 'pcs constraint delete'.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.  If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them use 'pcs location avoids'.
.TP
ban <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-master\fR] [lifetime=<lifetime>] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Prevent the resource id specified from running on the node (or on the current node it is running on if no node is specified) by creating a \-INFINITY location constraint.  If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id).  If lifetime is specified then the constraint will expire after that time, otherwise it defaults to infinity and the constraint can be cleared manually with 'pcs resource clear' or 'pcs constraint delete'.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the resource to move and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.  If you want the resource to preferably avoid running on some nodes but be able to failover to them use 'pcs location avoids'.
.TP
clear <resource id> [node] [\fB\-\-master\fR] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove constraints created by move and/or ban on the specified resource (and node if specified). If \fB\-\-master\fR is used the scope of the command is limited to the master role and you must use the master id (instead of the resource id).  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including starting and/or moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

update <resource id> [resource options] [op [<operation action> <operation options>]...] [meta <meta operations>...] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Add/Change options to specified resource, clone or multi\-state resource.  If an operation (op) is specified it will update the first found operation with the same action on the specified resource, if no operation with that action exists then a new operation will be created.  (WARNING: all existing options on the updated operation will be reset if not specified.)  If you want to create multiple monitor operations you should use the 'op add' & 'op remove' commands.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the changes to take effect and then return 0 if the changes have been processed or 1 otherwise.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP

Add the specified resource to the group, creating the group if it does not exist.  If the resource is present in another group it is moved to the new group.  You can use \fB\-\-before\fR or \fB\-\-after\fR to specify the position of the added resources relatively to some resource already existing in the group.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.

Remove the group (note: this does not remove any resources from the cluster) or if resources are specified, remove the specified resources from the group.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and the return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
clone <resource id | group id> [clone options]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Set up the specified resource or group as a clone. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including starting clone instances if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
unclone <resource id | group id> [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove the clone which contains the specified group or resource (the resource or group will not be removed).  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including stopping clone instances if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
master [<master/slave id>] <resource id | group id> [options] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Configure a resource or group as a multi\-state (master/slave) resource.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including starting and promoting resource instances if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.  Note: to remove a master you must remove the resource/group it contains.
.TP
bundle create <bundle id> [container [<container type>] <container options>] [network <network options>] [port\-map <port options>]... [storage\-map <storage options>]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Create a new bundle encapsulating no resources. The bundle can be used either as it is or a resource may be put into it at any time. If the container type is not specified, it defaults to 'docker'.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the bundle to start and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
bundle update <bundle id> [container <container options>] [network <network options>] [port\-map (add <port options>) | (remove <id>...)]... [storage\-map (add <storage options>) | (remove <id>...)]... [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Add, remove or change options to specified bundle. If you wish to update a resource encapsulated in the bundle, use the 'pcs resource update' command instead and specify the resource id.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the operation to finish (including moving resources if appropriate) and then return 0 on success or 1 on error.  If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
manage <resource id>... [\fB\-\-monitor\fR]
Set resources listed to managed mode (default). If \fB\-\-monitor\fR is specified, enable all monitor operations of the resources.
.TP
unmanage <resource id>... [\fB\-\-monitor\fR]
Set resources listed to unmanaged mode. When a resource is in unmanaged mode, the cluster is not allowed to start nor stop the resource. If \fB\-\-monitor\fR is specified, disable all monitor operations of the resources.
.TP
defaults [options]
Set default values for resources, if no options are passed, lists currently configured defaults.
.TP
cleanup [<resource id>] [\fB\-\-node\fR <node>]
Make the cluster forget the operation history of the resource and re\-detect its current state. This can be useful to purge knowledge of past failures that have since been resolved. If a resource id is not specified then all resources/stonith devices will be cleaned up. If a node is not specified then resources/stonith devices on all nodes will be cleaned up.
.TP
failcount show <resource id> [node]
Show current failcount for specified resource from all nodes or only on specified node.
.TP
failcount reset <resource id> [node]
Reset failcount for specified resource on all nodes or only on specified node. This tells the cluster to forget how many times a resource has failed in the past.  This may allow the resource to be started or moved to a more preferred location.
.TP
relocate dry\-run [resource1] [resource2] ...
The same as 'relocate run' but has no effect on the cluster.
.TP
relocate run [resource1] [resource2] ...
Relocate specified resources to their preferred nodes.  If no resources are specified, relocate all resources.  This command calculates the preferred node for each resource while ignoring resource stickiness.  Then it creates location constraints which will cause the resources to move to their preferred nodes.  Once the resources have been moved the constraints are deleted automatically.  Note that the preferred node is calculated based on current cluster status, constraints, location of resources and other settings and thus it might change over time.
.TP
relocate show
Display current status of resources and their optimal node ignoring resource stickiness.
.TP
relocate clear
Remove all constraints created by the 'relocate run' command.
.TP
utilization [<resource id> [<name>=<value> ...]]
Add specified utilization options to specified resource. If resource is not specified, shows utilization of all resources. If utilization options are not specified, shows utilization of specified resource. Utilization option should be in format name=value, value has to be integer. Options may be removed by setting an option without a value. Example: pcs resource utilization TestResource cpu= ram=20

.TP
auth [node] [...] [\fB\-u\fR username] [\fB\-p\fR password] [\fB\-\-force\fR] [\fB\-\-local\fR]
Authenticate pcs to pcsd on nodes specified, or on all nodes configured in the local cluster if no nodes are specified (authorization tokens are stored in ~/.pcs/tokens or /var/lib/pcsd/tokens for root). By default all nodes are also authenticated to each other, using \fB\-\-local\fR only authenticates the local node (and does not authenticate the remote nodes with each other). Using \fB\-\-force\fR forces re\-authentication to occur.
.TP
setup [\fB\-\-start\fR [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=<n>]]] [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fB\-\-enable\fR] \fB\-\-name\fR <cluster name> <node1[,node1\-altaddr]> [<node2[,node2\-altaddr]>] [...] [\fB\-\-transport\fR udpu|udp] [\fB\-\-rrpmode\fR active|passive] [\fB\-\-addr0\fR <addr/net> [[[\fB\-\-mcast0\fR <address>] [\fB\-\-mcastport0\fR <port>] [\fB\-\-ttl0\fR <ttl>]] | [\fB\-\-broadcast0\fR]] [\fB\-\-addr1\fR <addr/net> [[[\fB\-\-mcast1\fR <address>] [\fB\-\-mcastport1\fR <port>] [\fB\-\-ttl1\fR <ttl>]] | [\fB\-\-broadcast1\fR]]]] [\fB\-\-wait_for_all\fR=<0|1>] [\fB\-\-auto_tie_breaker\fR=<0|1>] [\fB\-\-last_man_standing\fR=<0|1> [\fB\-\-last_man_standing_window\fR=<time in ms>]] [\fB\-\-ipv6\fR] [\fB\-\-token\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-token_coefficient\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-join\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-consensus\fR <timeout>] [\fB\-\-miss_count_const\fR <count>] [\fB\-\-fail_recv_const\fR <failures>]
Configure corosync and sync configuration out to listed nodes. \fB\-\-local\fR will only perform changes on the local node, \fB\-\-start\fR will also start the cluster on the specified nodes, \fB\-\-wait\fR will wait up to 'n' seconds for the nodes to start, \fB\-\-enable\fR will enable corosync and pacemaker on node startup, \fB\-\-transport\fR allows specification of corosync transport (default: udpu; udp for CMAN clusters), \fB\-\-rrpmode\fR allows you to set the RRP mode of the system. Currently only 'passive' is supported or tested (using 'active' is not recommended). The \fB\-\-wait_for_all\fR, \fB\-\-auto_tie_breaker\fR, \fB\-\-last_man_standing\fR, \fB\-\-last_man_standing_window\fR options are all documented in corosync's votequorum(5) man page. These options are not supported on CMAN clusters.

\fB\-\-ipv6\fR will configure corosync to use ipv6 (instead of ipv4).  This option is not supported on CMAN clusters.

\fB\-\-token\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds until a token loss is declared after not receiving a token (default 1000 ms)

\fB\-\-token_coefficient\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds used for clusters with at least 3 nodes as a coefficient for real token timeout calculation (token + (number_of_nodes - 2) * token_coefficient) (default 650 ms)  This option is not supported on CMAN clusters.

\fB\-\-join\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds to wait for join messages (default 50 ms)

\fB\-\-consensus\fR <timeout> sets time in milliseconds to wait for consensus to be achieved before starting a new round of membership configuration (default 1200 ms)

\fB\-\-miss_count_const\fR <count> sets the maximum number of times on receipt of a token a message is checked for retransmission before a retransmission occurs (default 5 messages)

\fB\-\-fail_recv_const\fR <failures> specifies how many rotations of the token without receiving any messages when messages should be received may occur before a new configuration is formed (default 2500 failures)


Configuring Redundant Ring Protocol (RRP)

When using udpu specifying nodes, specify the ring 0 address first
followed by a ',' and then the ring 1 address.

Example: pcs cluster setup \-\-name cname nodeA\-0,nodeA\-1 nodeB\-0,nodeB\-1

When using udp, using \fB\-\-addr0\fR and \fB\-\-addr1\fR will allow you to configure
rrp mode for corosync.  It's recommended to use a network (instead of
IP address) for \fB\-\-addr0\fR and \fB\-\-addr1\fR so the same corosync.conf file can
be used around the cluster.  \fB\-\-mcast0\fR defaults to 239.255.1.1 and
\fB\-\-mcast1\fR defaults to 239.255.2.1, \fB\-\-mcastport0/1\fR default to 5405 and
ttl defaults to 1. If \fB\-\-broadcast\fR is specified, \fB\-\-mcast0/1\fR,
\fB\-\-mcastport0/1\fR & \fB\-\-ttl0/1\fR are ignored.
.TP
start [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>... ] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=<n>]]
Start corosync & pacemaker on specified node(s), if a node is not specified then corosync & pacemaker are started on the local node. If \fB\-\-all\fR is specified then corosync & pacemaker are started on all nodes. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, wait up to 'n' seconds for nodes to start.
.TP
stop [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>... ] [\fB\-\-request\-timeout\fR=<seconds>]
Stop corosync & pacemaker on specified node(s), if a node is not specified then corosync & pacemaker are stopped on the local node. If \fB\-\-all\fR is specified then corosync & pacemaker are stopped on all nodes. If the cluster is running resources which take long time to stop, the request may time out before the cluster actually stops. In that case you should consider setting \fB\-\-request\-timeout\fR to a suitable value.
.TP
kill
Force corosync and pacemaker daemons to stop on the local node (performs kill \-9). Note that init system (e.g. systemd) can detect that cluster is not running and start it again. If you want to stop cluster on a node, run pcs cluster stop on that node.
.TP
enable [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>... ]
Configure cluster to run on node boot on specified node(s). If node is not specified then cluster is enabled on the local node. If \fB\-\-all\fR is specified then cluster is enabled on all nodes.
.TP
disable [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>... ]
Configure cluster to not run on node boot on specified node(s). If node is not specified then cluster is disabled on the local node. If \fB\-\-all\fR is specified then cluster is disabled on all nodes.
.TP
status
View current cluster status (an alias of 'pcs status cluster').
.TP
pcsd\-status [<node>]...
Show current status of pcsd on nodes specified, or on all nodes configured in the local cluster if no nodes are specified.

.TP
cib [filename] [scope=<scope> | \fB\-\-config\fR]
Get the raw xml from the CIB (Cluster Information Base).  If a filename is provided, we save the CIB to that file, otherwise the CIB is printed.  Specify scope to get a specific section of the CIB.  Valid values of the scope are: configuration, nodes, resources, constraints, crm_config, rsc_defaults, op_defaults, status.  \fB\-\-config\fR is the same as scope=configuration.  Do not specify a scope if you want to edit the saved CIB using pcs (pcs \-f <command>).
.TP
cib\-push <filename> [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=<n>]] [diff\-against=<filename_original> | scope=<scope> | \fB\-\-config\fR]
Push the raw xml from <filename> to the CIB (Cluster Information Base).  You can obtain the CIB by running the 'pcs cluster cib' command, which is recommended first step when you want to perform desired modifications (pcs \fB\-f\fR <command>) for the one\-off push.  If diff\-against is specified, pcs diffs contents of filename against contents of filename_original and pushes the result to the CIB.  Specify scope to push a specific section of the CIB.  Valid values of the scope are: configuration, nodes, resources, constraints, crm_config, rsc_defaults, op_defaults.  \fB\-\-config\fR is the same as scope=configuration.  Use of \fB\-\-config\fR is recommended.  Do not specify a scope if you need to push the whole CIB or be warned in the case of outdated CIB.  If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified wait up to 'n' seconds for changes to be applied.  WARNING: the selected scope of the CIB will be overwritten by the current content of the specified file.

Example:
    pcs cluster cib > original.xml
    cp original.xml new.xml
    pcs \-f new.xml constraint location apache prefers node2
    pcs cluster cib\-push new.xml diff\-against=original.xml

import\-cman output=<filename> [input=<filename>] [\fB\-\-interactive\fR] output\-format=pcs\-commands|pcs\-commands\-verbose [dist=<dist>]
Converts CMAN cluster configuration to a list of pcs commands which recreates the same cluster as Pacemaker cluster when executed.  Commands will be saved to 'output' file.  For other options see above.
.TP
export pcs\-commands|pcs\-commands\-verbose [output=<filename>] [dist=<dist>]
Creates a list of pcs commands which upon execution recreates the current cluster running on this node.  Commands will be saved to 'output' file or written to stdout if 'output' is not specified.  Use pcs\-commands to get a simple list of commands, whereas pcs\-commands\-verbose creates a list including comments and debug messages.  Optionally specify output version by setting 'dist' option e. g. rhel,6.8 or redhat,7.3 or debian,7 or ubuntu,trusty.  You can get the list of supported dist values by running the "clufter \fB\-\-list\-dists\fR" command.  If 'dist' is not specified, it defaults to this node's version.
.SS "pcsd"
.TP
certkey <certificate file> <key file>
Load custom certificate and key files for use in pcsd.
.TP
sync\-certificates
Sync pcsd certificates to all nodes in the local cluster. WARNING: This will restart pcsd daemon on the nodes.
.TP
clear\-auth [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fB\-\-remote\fR]
Removes all system tokens which allow pcs/pcsd on the current system to authenticate with remote pcs/pcsd instances and vice\-versa.  After this command is run this node will need to be re\-authenticated with other nodes (using 'pcs cluster auth').  Using \fB\-\-local\fR only removes tokens used by local pcs (and pcsd if root) to connect to other pcsd instances, using \fB\-\-remote\fR clears authentication tokens used by remote systems to connect to the local pcsd instance.
.SS "node"
.TP
attribute [[<node>] [\fB\-\-name\fR <name>] | <node> <name>=<value> ...]
Manage node attributes.  If no parameters are specified, show attributes of all nodes.  If one parameter is specified, show attributes of specified node.  If \fB\-\-name\fR is specified, show specified attribute's value from all nodes.  If more parameters are specified, set attributes of specified node.  Attributes can be removed by setting an attribute without a value.
.TP
maintenance [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>...] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Put specified node(s) into maintenance mode, if no nodes or options are specified the current node will be put into maintenance mode, if \fB\-\-all\fR is specified all nodes will be put into maintenance mode. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the node(s) to be put into maintenance mode and then return 0 on success or 1 if the operation not succeeded yet. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
unmaintenance [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>...] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove node(s) from maintenance mode, if no nodes or options are specified the current node will be removed from maintenance mode, if \fB\-\-all\fR is specified all nodes will be removed from maintenance mode. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the node(s) to be removed from maintenance mode and then return 0 on success or 1 if the operation not succeeded yet. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
standby [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>...] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Put specified node(s) into standby mode (the node specified will no longer be able to host resources), if no nodes or options are specified the current node will be put into standby mode, if \fB\-\-all\fR is specified all nodes will be put into standby mode. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the node(s) to be put into standby mode and then return 0 on success or 1 if the operation not succeeded yet. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
unstandby [\fB\-\-all\fR | <node>...] [\fB\-\-wait\fR[=n]]
Remove node(s) from standby mode (the node specified will now be able to host resources), if no nodes or options are specified the current node will be removed from standby mode, if \fB\-\-all\fR is specified all nodes will be removed from standby mode. If \fB\-\-wait\fR is specified, pcs will wait up to 'n' seconds for the node(s) to be removed from standby mode and then return 0 on success or 1 if the operation not succeeded yet. If 'n' is not specified it defaults to 60 minutes.
.TP
utilization [[<node>] [\fB\-\-name\fR <name>] | <node> <name>=<value> ...]
Add specified utilization options to specified node.  If node is not specified, shows utilization of all nodes.  If \fB\-\-name\fR is specified, shows specified utilization value from all nodes. If utilization options are not specified, shows utilization of specified node.  Utilization option should be in format name=value, value has to be integer.  Options may be removed by setting an option without a value.  Example: pcs node utilization node1 cpu=4 ram=
.SS "alert"
