## PCS - Pacemaker/Corosync Configuration System

Pcs is a Corosync and Pacemaker configuration tool. It permits users to
easily view, modify and create Pacemaker based clusters. Pcs contains pcsd, a
pcs daemon, which operates as a remote server for pcs and provides a web UI.

### Installation from Source

These are the runtime dependencies of pcs and pcsd:
* python 2.7+
* python-lxml / python3-lxml
* python-pycurl / python3-pycurl
* python-setuptools / python3-setuptools
* ruby 2.0.0+
* killall (package psmisc)
* openssl
* corosync
* pacemaker

It is also recommended to have these:
* python-clufter / python3-clufter
* liberation fonts (package liberation-sans-fonts or fonts-liberation or
  fonts-liberation2)
* overpass fonts (package overpass-fonts)

If you plan to manage Corosync 1.x based clusters, you will also need:
* cman
* ccs

It is however highly recommended for new clusters to use Corosync 2.x.
Support for Corosync 1.x and CMAN has been deprecated in 0.9.160 and will be
removed.

Apart from the dependencies listed above, these are also required for
installation:

* python development files (package python-devel / python3-devel)
* ruby development files (package ruby-devel)
* rubygems
* rubygem bundler (package rubygem-bundler or ruby-bundler or bundler)
* gcc
* gcc-c++
* PAM development files (package pam-devel or libpam0g-dev)
* FFI development files (package libffi-devel or libffi-dev)
* fontconfig
* printf (package coreutils)
* redhat-rpm-config if you are using Fedora

During the installation, all required rubygems are automatically downloaded and
compiled.

To install pcs and pcsd run the following in terminal:
```shell
# tar -xzvf pcs-0.9.160.tar.gz
# cd pcs-0.9.160
# make install
# make install_pcsd
```

If you are using GNU/Linux with systemd, it is now time to:
```shell
# systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start pcsd and make it start on boot:
```shell
# systemctl start pcsd
# systemctl enable pcsd
```

### Quick Start

* **Authenticate cluster nodes**

  Set the same password for the `hacluster` user on all nodes.
  ```shell
  # passwd hacluster
  ```

  To authenticate the nodes, run the following command on one of the nodes
  (replacing node1, node2, node3 with a list of nodes in your future cluster).
  Specify all your cluster nodes in the command. Make sure pcsd is running on
  all nodes.
  ```shell
  # pcs cluster auth node1 node2 node3 -u hacluster
  ```

* **Create a cluster**

  To create a cluster run the following command on one node (replacing
  cluster\_name with a name of your cluster and node1, node2, node3 with a list
  of nodes in the cluster). `--start` and `--enable` will start your cluster
  and configure the nodes to start the cluster on boot respectively.
  ```shell
  # pcs cluster setup --name cluster_name node1 node2 node3 --start --enable
  ```

* **Check the cluster status**

   After a few moments the cluster should startup and you can get the status of
   the cluster.
   ```shell
   # pcs status
   ```

* **Add cluster resources**

   After this you can add stonith agents and resources:
   ```shell
   # pcs -h stonith create
   ```
   and
   ```shell
   # pcs -h resource create
   ```

### Accessing the Web UI

Apart from command line interface you can use web user interface to view and
configure your cluster. To access the web UI open a browser to the following
URL (replace nodename with an address of your node):
```
https://nodename:2224
```
Login as the `hacluster` user.
